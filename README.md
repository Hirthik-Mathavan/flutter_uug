# Universal Interactive User Guide

This is a mobile application built using Flutter. It is made compatible with both IOS and Android devices. This application is used to get information (Maintenance, Installation, Troubleshooting, Repair and Help & Tips) regarding a particular product by scanning its barcode or typing it manually. The interface of our application is simplistic, and a novice user will be able to use the application without any help. With the help of API and AI, we alleviate the user experience with the application and make getting all information regarding the product as easy as a single tap. 

The user experience can be further enhanced by adding features such as Google vision API (to detect the product by scanning it), a history of scanned products and even an AR guide for repairs of the product. 

**Problem Statement**

Usually, after we buy a new product, the user manual that comes with them stays in the same box of the product and goes into the garage. We rarely open them. When it comes to repairing or maintaining any of the products after a few months, most of us prefer to search the internet for a solution rather than referring to the user manual. 

However, the results we get from the internet may not be specific to the product as we search only by giving a few details about the product as details of the model are not displayed on the product. 

So, what if there was an app that provided us with all the necessary details of a specific product, from troubleshooting, repairs, installation and everything that one needs to know with just one click?
